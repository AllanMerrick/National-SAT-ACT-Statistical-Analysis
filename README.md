Problem Statement
We look at collective participation rates between ACT and SAT testing results between individual states. Our goal is to identify patterns in participation rates and identify possible influences a College Board can leverage to increase High School senior participation.

Executive Summary:
States found heavy preferential treatment between SAT and ACT scores. Participation rates are consistently skewed in favor of one or the other. Further investigation after identifying a large swing in Colorado from ACT's to SAT's in 2018, we find that State School Boards coordinate directly with owners of SAT/ACT and can directly influence participation by setting high-school requirements to take the test, state-wide.

Conclusions:
Based on your exploration of the data, what are you key takeaways and recommendations? Choose one state with a lower participation rate and provide a suggestion for how the College Board might increase participation amongst graduating seniors in this state. Are there additional data you desire that would better inform your investigations?

TakeAways:
- State School Boards hold heavy weight in student participation,  unlike College Boards which can only dictate their singular school acceptance requirements.
- As colleges also report on student acceptance and typically do not require ACT/SAT's, a College Board should align their SAT/ACT requirements with their State School Board's selection.
- As we saw in Colorado, regardless of College acceptance requirements in regards to SAT/ACT scores: State School Boards pay for these tests and can mandate requirement for High School Graduation.
- Additional Data that would better inform us:
 - State College Board member financial stake in ACT/SAT owners
 - SAT/ACT test owner lobby and influence in each state
 - College Acceptance Rates vs ACT/SAT test requirements
